Built during Request Network Summer Hackaton 2024

Freelance smarter, send a wavein.

Wavein allows freelancers to be paid in real time with a simple link. Powered by Request Network and Superfluid.

## Features

### Create a wavein
Simply input the payer, the reason for the payment, due date, and amount, and a new wavein will be created. This wavein contains a Request Network request with the necessary streaming data.

### Accept a wavein
After verifying that the wavein details are correct, the payer can confirm the wavein by wrapping USDC to USDCx and then initializing the stream.

### View wavein
The freelancer can unwrap the USDCx back to USDC. The freelancer's real-time balance will be shown on this page. We also have an invoice button where you can download an invoice with all the necessary data, including when the streaming was initialized, how much of the USDCx has been converted to USDC, etc.

### Freelancer dashboard
Using our customized API, we deliver a beautiful dashboard where the freelancer can see their payments and stats for the month.
